# My development environment (no IDE)
- for C, C++ as well as Embedded Systems development
## Tools and configuration
- I am using Nvim Text based editor: I chose Nvim over Vim though as it has better community support (its highly likely that a new feature would come up earlier in Nvim), its seemingly faster as well as easier to configure with Lua in comparision
- Nvin was brew installed on mac

```
brew install neovim

```
### Nvim configuration
- the follwing plugins are installed:
    - [packer.nvim]("https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim"): nvim package manager, configured to display a pop-up window during startup and update
    - [nvim-lua/plenary.nvim]("https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"): contains lua funtions on which other plugins are have depencies on
    - [bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors]("https://github.com/"): just a dark theme that I kind of liked
