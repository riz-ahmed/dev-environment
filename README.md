### Nvim configuration
#### options setup
- I search for and add files using the wildmenu option enabled as well as using the _argsadd_ command. I find this apprach to be faster that using the telescope plugin
- the follwing plugins are installed:
    - [packer.nvim]("https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim"): nvim package manager, configured to display a pop-up window during startup and update
    - [nvim-lua/plenary.nvim]("https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"): contains lua funtions on which other plugins are have depencies on
    - [bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors]("https://github.com/"): just a dark theme that I kind of liked
